# Machine-learning-final-project
Customer behavior analysis project using ML (FAST University). Includes RFM analysis, KMeans clustering, churn prediction with Random Forest, forecasting with Prophet, and SHAP for model interpretability. Helps identify churn risk and forecast revenue trends.
# Customer Churn and Behavior Analysis

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning course. It aims to analyze customer behavior using multiple machine learning techniques, including clustering, classification, forecasting, and model interpretability.

## 📌 Objectives
- Segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Predict customer churn using Random Forest
- Forecast customer activity/revenue using Facebook Prophet
- Explain model predictions using SHAP

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- **KMeans Clustering** for customer segmentation
- **Random Forest Classifier** for churn prediction
- **Facebook Prophet** for time series forecasting
- **Apriori Algorithm** for association rules
- **SHAP** for feature importance visualization

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- prophet
- mlxtend (Apriori)
- shap

## 📈 Results
- Identified customer segments for targeted marketing
- Built a churn prediction model with good accuracy
- Generated future revenue trends using time-series forecasting
- Used SHAP to understand which features contribute most to churn
